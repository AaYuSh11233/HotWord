As this is an ongoing project by students in their early stages of their academic journey, we acknowledge that the system may not be perfect and is continuously evolving. We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community to help improve our project.

## Current Performance

While our system is still under development, we are continuously working to improve its performance. Current metrics:

- False Acceptance Rate (FAR): < 0.5%
- False Rejection Rate (FRR): < 3%
- Response Time: < 500ms

Please note that these metrics are subject to change as we refine our algorithms and expand our training data. Detailed benchmarking results and comparison with other systems are available in the `docs/benchmarks.md` file.

### False Positive Reduction

Custom loss functions and training techniques are employed to minimize false activations, crucial for hotword detection systems.

## Customization

To train for a specific hotword (e.g., "kurma"):
1. Add multiple recordings of the hotword "kurma" to the `data/hotword/` directory.
2. Add various non-hotword audio samples to the `data/non_hotword/` directory.
3. Adjust the `MODEL_TYPE` in `config.py` if you want to experiment with different model architectures.
4. Run the `main.py` script to start the training process.

## Future Work

- Implement more sophisticated room simulation techniques for data augmentation
- Explore TTS-based data generation for expanding the dataset
- Implement additional advanced model architectures
- Further optimize the training process with techniques like curriculum learning
- Develop a user-friendly interface for model customization and deployment
- Implement a streaming inference pipeline for real-time detection
